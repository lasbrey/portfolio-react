# Front-End Developer Portfolio

## Built with React, Tailwind, and Firebase

Welcome to my front-end developer portfolio! I am excited to showcase my work and skills to you.

This portfolio was built using the following technologies:

- React - a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Tailwind - a utility-first CSS framework for rapid prototyping and styling
- Firebase - a platform for building web and mobile applications, providing services such as authentication, database management, and hosting
  

Each project in this portfolio showcases my ability to build modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications using these technologies. Whether it's a single-page application or a full-stack web application, I am confident in my ability to deliver high-quality projects that meet the needs of my clients.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you enjoy exploring my work and learning more about my skills and experience. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or want to discuss potential collaboration.
